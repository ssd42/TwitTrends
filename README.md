# TwitTrends

This is an early version of a project I developed for a friend.

# The point of it

I stream in data from twitter based on a provided keyword(s)

```
i.e. you pass the word "soccer"
```

this will then stream in all data from twitter using tweepy and goes through it giving a point value to it based on it's 'freshness' (how recent the tweet is) then it will agregate all the data into popular hashtags, @ mentions and urls based on that keyword(s).

The idea is that over time you'd be able to see what are the trends of a current niche market and attempt to target the people who follow people that follow certain users, user certain hashtags and tend to go to certain websites. This is just the last build I had on my pc before I began working with my friend.
